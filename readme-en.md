# Web accessibility overlays lists

<i lang="fr">[Version fran√ßaise](readme.md)</i>

There are a lot of web accessibility overlays.

You can find below a non-exhaustive list of these tools.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you want to install one of these tools (or another one):

1. **At first, make you website compliant with WCAG rules at the AA level at least** (or with other accessibility reference from your country but based on WCAG);
1. **Then, test each functionality of the tool you have installed on the different pages of your website** to ensure that everything is functional and that new accessibility issues do not arise.

Indeed, unfortunately, and even if it is sometimes promised, **no tool can make a website fully compliant with WCAG rules or fully accessible to all disabled people**.

## Open-source free tools

- [AccessConfig](https://accessconfig.a11y.fr/)
- [Confort de lecture](http://www.confortdelecture.org/)
- [One Click Accessibility](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pojo-accessibility/) (WordPress plugin)
- [Orange Confort+](https://confort-plus.orange.com/): this tool is different because it is mainly a free browser extension but it is possible to install it on your own site as well; this is not recommended. Instead, it is recommended to suggest that users install the extension if they want to change the appearance of the site according to their needs. In this way, they will be able to change the appearance of all the websites they visit.
- [WP Accessibility](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-accessibility/): this WordPress plugin fixes common accessibility problems in themes and has, in addition, a ‚ÄúToolbar‚Äù module which is an accessibility overlay.
- [WP Accessibility Helper](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-accessibility-helper/) (WordPress plugin - it has also a paid version)
